                    Flying Cars also known as the future of human transportation have been a thought 
                    in humans since a long time and is now slowly turning into a reality through years 
                    of research by several companies. This is the page where you will understand how 
                    exactly R&D departments of companies like ‘Volocopter’, ‘The Boeing Company’, 
                    ‘Klein Vision’ and <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/all-the-flying-cars-and-taxis-currently-in-development/">several others</a> putting in motion these evTOL projects.

            <div class="content">
            <p>
                There has been a dream of having a flying car since the 18th century when there 
                was an attempt of making a gliding horse cart, which for obvious reasons had failed 
                but there were many attempts that followed which also failed in some or the other 
                way due to some or the other reason. The first or the main attempt that I am going 
                to talk about over here is the <b>Curtiss Autoplane</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Curtiss Autoplane:</b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    in 1917, Glenn Curtiss who is also called as the father of flying cars by many, 
                    he unveiled the first attempt at a flying car at New York’s pan American 
                    Aeronautical Exposition. Like a car, it had an aluminum body, and the windows 
                    were made by plastic, and it also included a heater. But, since not every first 
                    attempt works out this did not too. There were many rumors that the plane did not 
                    fly but the truth is that it just couldn’t take a full flight but it managed to 
                    take a few short hops.

                <br>
                <p>Let us jump into one of the first working attempt at flying cars.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Airphibian:</b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    in 1946, Robert Fulton developed the Airphibian. But the way he thought was 
                    quite different than others, instead of creating a car which could fly he 
                    created a plane which could drive on the road which was fully functional and was 
                    also certified by the Civil Aeronautics Administration now know as 
                    <a href="https://www.faa.gov/">Federal Aviation Administration(FAA)</a>. It had 150 horsepower and could fly at the 
                    speed of 150mph and could drive at the speed of 50mph. But, this attempt also 
                    floundered due to insufficient amount of money.

                    There are mainly 3 types of flying car concepts:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The PAL-V model</li>
                        <li>The simple airplane model</li>
                        <li>The drone model</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>PAL-V:</b>
                    <br>
                    This is the model is created by PAL-V. It’s the model in which the automobile has retractable rotors and can be driven on a road using the 
                    three wheels it stands on. It steers like a car but banks like a motorcycle. Many people assume it’s a helicopter that can stay on land 
                    for a longer time, but it actually contains a lot of mechanics 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Simple Airplane Concept:</b>
                    <br>
                    This is the model which comes in the mind of many. It’s basically an automobile containing retractable airfoils and rest of it is like 
                    a simple car containing a small engine. This concept was recently seen in Klein-Visions take on the flying car which contained a 1.6L 
                    petrol BMW Engine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Drone Concept:</b>
                    <br>
                    This is the model used in small drones used for security, videography, photography, utility and even as a toy for teenagers. 
                    It’s basically an automobile which has multiple rotors on top of it and using the perfect weight distribution it takes lift. This concept 
                    was recently seen in volocopter’s take on the flying cars which is a German aircraft manufacturer.
